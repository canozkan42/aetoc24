This workshop has always provided opportunities for the delegates to exchange new ideas, to establish research relations as well as to find global partners for future collaborations.

We sincerely hope meeting you in the fruitful, inspiring and friendly atmosphere that has always distinguished AETOC from the other scientific conferences.
